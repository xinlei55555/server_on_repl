1. Do not push the requirements.txt file, as it may conflict with repl.it's automatic package management system
2. MAKE SURE THE LANGUAGE SELECTED (When importing a github repo or just pushing files) is correct! (bash is not the same thing as python!)
3. always create a file that is called .replit that contains:
    run  = "python <here_we_would_put_the_first_file_that_we_want_to_run.py>"
    language = "python3"

5. The rest is pretty straight forward and repl.it manages it pretty well.
